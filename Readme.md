#RedStarter by David Comdico

A basic starter toolkit for SCSS prototyping Drupal projects
The architecture is based on Harry Roberts' Inverted CSS.

##Getting Started

This project uses Node and Gulp. These will need to be installed on your machine if they are not already. This page contains instructions for doing so: [travismaynard.com/writing/getting-started-with-gulp] (https://travismaynard.com/writing/getting-started-with-gulp).

To get started run 'npm install' and then 'Gulp.'
